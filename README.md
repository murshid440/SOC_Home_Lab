# Cybersecurity Home Lab Project

This project is a simulation of a SOC analyst's work environment created using VMware, which includes an Ubuntu server and a Windows machine. The aim of this project was to gain practical experience in the field of cybersecurity and demonstrate my technical skill sets.

## Project Goals

1. To create a virtualized environment that simulates a SOC analyst's work environment.
2. To configure and secure an Ubuntu server and a Windows machine.
3. To disable Windows Defender on the Windows machine using Group Policy and Registry settings.
4. To use Silver Server to create a C2 payload and Python to download it onto the Windows machine.
5. To implement Sysmon and Limacharlie to monitor and analyze telemetry, process, and network activity of malware.
6. To conduct hash analysis to identify and understand the malicious behavior of the malware.
7. To develop and implement custom detection rules to proactively detect and mitigate malicious activity, including       ransomware attacks and brute-force attempts.
8. To demonstrate proficiency in using command-line interfaces to connect to the Windows machine and terminate parent activity during a simulated ransomware attack.

## Skills Demonstrated

* Proficiency in using VMware to create a virtualized environment.
* Understanding of Windows operating systems and Group Policy.
* Knowledge of Silver Server and Python programming language.
* Experience in using Sysmon and Limacharlie to monitor and analyze malware behavior.
* Knowledge of hash analysis and detection rules development.
